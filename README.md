Building JavaScript Games - Project 1.

>Game programming exercise form Arjan Egges' [Building JavaScript Games](http://www.apress.com/us/book/9781430265382).

The game serves as an introduction to writing effective JavaScript game engines for simple 2D games.

The first half of the book introduces basic ideas behind the game loop, object classes, properties, inheritence, as well as adding interactivity, and creating and updating game objects.

>Rules:<br>
>The player can aim with her mouse, while changing the colour of the projectile with the R-G-B keys.<br>
>The aim is to paint the cans to the correct colour (indicated by large arrows) before they fall down the bottom of the screen.<br>
>You can take a shot with a left click and the further you hold the corsshair from the cannon the higher velocity you get for the projectiles. But keep in mind that there is gravity, so the balls won't end up flying towards the crosshair. <br>
>Five yellow baloons under the scoreboard indicate the player's life. <br>
>You can try the game [here](http://www.davidmelhart.com/portfolio/buildingJSgames/Painter/)!<br>
>Have fun! :) And sorry in advance for the music! (You can kill it from console with the "sounds.music.volume = 0" command ;))
